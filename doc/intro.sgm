		<title>RLIB in a nutshell</title>
		<para>
			RLIB is a report generation library/language.  It takes advantage of today's best web technology including PHP, SQL, and XML.  
			Because speed is an extremely important with web applications, and requests must be completed with sub second response time, 
			c was	chosen as the language in which to implement RLIB.
		</para>
		<para>
			One of the main advantages to RLIB is that you don't have to be a programmer in order to use it. The file format for describing 
			reports is XML.  RLIB supports full expression evaluation in human readable format so it is easy to follow the logic behind 
			a report.
		</para>
		<para>
			This manual assumes you have prior knowledge of XML and SQL, and also basic PHP.  DON'T PANIC if you don't know what these 
			technologies are.	We will cover in detail the exact XML you are expected to know, and the PHP api to RLIB 
			(which is all you need to know).  We won't cover SQL queries, except for the examples given.

			RLIB is open source.  Because of that, you might take the time to review the code and possibly make changes to improve
			it.  SICOM Systems would be happy to review your changes, and possibly include them in future releases of RLIB.  To find

		<title>What is a Report Writer</title>
		<para>
			There are many report writers that exist, however the basic principles are the same.  Loop through data sets printing out 
			records in a specified format.  Also allow for intelligent page breaking, report headers and footers, page headers and footers, 
			allow for data	grouping and breaking for subtotal.  Be able to define variables that operate on columns (sum, average) that may 
			reset on breaks.  Also allow report columns to be mathamatical equations supporting a variety of functions.
		</para>
		<para>
			RLIB supports all of this and more.
