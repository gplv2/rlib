There is lots of stuff that needs to be done:

* Take Input Logic Out Of the Engine and add more INPUTS (POSTGREE, flat file.. ext)
* Don't use PHP memory management
* Split RLIB from PHP.. have different language bindings.. (PHP, PERL, PYTHON, C, .NET)
* Graphing
* Better HTML Exporting.. DHTML???
* Millions of little things
